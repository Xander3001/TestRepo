The overall code is a test suite for three different neural network architectures - Basic Neural Network, Perceptron, and LSTM - on various tasks. The tests include validating their ability to learn logic gates, predict sin values, and perform discrete sequence recall.

# Basic Neural Network:
- `describe('Basic Neural Network', function ()` - overall test suite for Basic Neural Network
- `it("trains an AND gate", function ()` - test to train and validate the network's ability to learn an AND gate
- `it("trains an OR gate", function ()` - test to train and validate the network's ability to learn an OR gate
- `it("trains a NOT gate", function ()` - test to train and validate the network's ability to learn a NOT gate

# Perceptron:
- `describe("Perceptron - SIN", function ()` - overall test suite for Perceptron
- `it("should return value around " + y + " when [" + x + "] is on input", function ()` - test to validate the network's ability to predict sin values
- `it("Sin error: " + errorResult, function ()` - test to check the error in the network's predictions

# LSTM:
- `describe("LSTM - Discrete Sequence Recall", function ()` - overall test suite for LSTM
- `trainer.DSR({...})` - trains the network for discrete sequence recall
- `it((i + 1) + ") input: " + sequence[i] + " output: " + value(test.prediction), function ()` - tests the network's ability to recall a sequence of numbers.
