This code includes tests for several neural network models, including a basic neural network for AND, OR, and NOT gates, a Perceptron for computing the sine function, and an LSTM for discrete sequence recall. Each test includes specific input and expected output values, and uses the assert library to check that the model's output matches the expected values. Additionally, some tests include comments explaining the purpose of the test and the expected behavior.
