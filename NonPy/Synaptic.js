The overall code consists of several test suites for different types of neural networks. Each test suite contains multiple individual tests to check the accuracy of the network. 

The "Basic Neural Network" suite tests the network's ability to learn AND, OR, and NOT gates. 

The "Perceptron - SIN" suite tests the network's ability to learn the sine function, using a Perceptron architecture. It includes a cross-validation test. 

The "LSTM - Discrete Sequence Recall" suite tests the network's ability to recall a sequence of numbers, using a LSTM architecture. 

Each test is thoroughly documented with comments explaining the purpose of the test and the expected output.
