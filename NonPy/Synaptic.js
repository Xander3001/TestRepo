The code above contains test cases for various neural network models. Each test case has a description and checks the output of the model against expected values using the 'assert' library. The test cases are:
- Basic Neural Network with AND, OR and NOT gates.
- Perceptron with SIN function (single input, single output).
- Perceptron with SIN function and CrossValidation.
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with Discrete Sequence Recall.
