This code consists of three different test suites that test the functionality of various neural network types, including the basic neural network, perceptron, and LSTM networks. 

The first test suite tests the basic neural network's ability to train an AND, OR, and NOT gate using trainer and trainingSet to ensure the outputs are as expected. 

The second test suite tests the perceptron network's ability to learn a sine function using a given training set and cross-validation testing. 

The third test suite tests the LSTM network's ability to perform discrete sequence recall (DSR) by generating input and output based on a provided sequence, targets, distractors, and prompts.
