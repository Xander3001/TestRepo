The code contains several sets of tests for different neural network models. 

The first set of tests is for a basic neural network that can be trained to act as an AND gate, OR gate, and NOT gate. Each gate is trained separately, and after training, the network is tested with the expected inputs and their outputs are compared with the expected outputs.

The second set of tests is for a Perceptron that can learn to compute the sine function. The network is trained with a set of inputs and their corresponding sine values. After training, the network is tested with some inputs, and their outputs are compared with the expected sine values.

The third set of tests is for a Perceptron that can learn to compute the sine function using cross-validation. This means that during training, part of the data is held out for testing, and the network is trained on the remaining data. This is repeated several times, and the errors on the held-out data are averaged to assess the network's performance.

The fourth set of tests is for a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that is trained to recall a sequence of symbols. The sequence is composed of a set of target symbols, a set of distractor symbols, and a set of prompt symbols. The network is trained to recall the target symbols when prompted with the prompt symbols. After training, the network is tested with a sequence of symbols and the correctness of the recalled target symbols is checked.
