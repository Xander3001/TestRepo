This code loads data contracts from a SQL Server database and from JSON files located in a directory, and merges them into a single dataframe. It then overwrites the data in the SQL Server database with the updated data, removing any old contracts for the current branch and adding any new contracts. The code also uses tracing to create spans that track the progress and performance of the code.
