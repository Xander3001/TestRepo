This code is responsible for loading data contracts from JSON files and updating an existing contracts table in an SQL database. The code starts by retrieving information about the notebook's repository and branch. It then loads existing contract data from the SQL database and logs the number of loaded records. The code proceeds to load new contract files from the repository's config directory, collates them together and logs the number of loaded files. The new contracts are then matched against the SQL database's existing contract data by branch, with any old contracts for the current branch being removed. The updated contract data is then written back to the SQL database, and the number of written records is logged. Throughout the process, events are added to a tracing system using a distributed tracing library, which can be used to monitor the progress of the code.
