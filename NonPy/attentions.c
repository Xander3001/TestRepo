The overall code seems to be a collection of functions for using neural networks to predict or evaluate image data. The functions included are:
- extend_data_truth(): manipulates the data structure to add columns of a specified value to the truth values of an input.
- network_loss_data(): computes the loss of a given network on a test dataset using forward propagation.
- validate_attention_multi(): validates a given network on a set of image files and outputs the accuracy at specified top-k values.
- predict_attention(): uses a given network to predict the image classification for a single file and outputs the top-k classifications with their corresponding probabilities.
