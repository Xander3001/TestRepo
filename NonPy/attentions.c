Function extend_data_truth takes a pointer to a data structure d, an integer n, and a float value val as input. It extends the columns of the y attribute of the data structure by allocating memory for it using the realloc function and assigns the value val to the newly added columns.

Function network_loss_data takes a pointer to a network structure net and a data structure test as input. It makes predictions on the test data in batches and computes the loss in the process. It returns a matrix of predicted values.

Function validate_attention_multi takes char pointers to training data configuration file (datacfg), filename, and trained weights file (weightfile) as input. It loads the network and data configurations, reads the paths to validation data, and then performs multi-scale prediction on all the data to get accuracy and topk values.

Function predict_attention takes char pointers to data configuration file (datacfg), network configuration file (cfgfile), trained weights file (weightfile), filename, and the number of top predictions desired as input. It loads the network and data configurations, reads the input image, and then performs prediction on the image using the loaded network. It prints the top class predictions and their probabilities.
