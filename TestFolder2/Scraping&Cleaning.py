The overall purpose of this code is to extract data from a Reddit subreddit using the 'praw' Python library and perform data cleaning activities such as lowercasing, removing special characters and stopwords, and tokenization. The cleaned data is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis. Specifically, this code fetches the top 10,000 hot posts from a subreddit related to machine learning, cleans the text of the posts, removes empty entries, and creates a new DataFrame to store the cleaned data.
