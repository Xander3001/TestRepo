The code is scraping the 'hot' posts from a subreddit related to machine learning and creating a Pandas DataFrame 'posts' with the titles, scores, IDs, subreddits, URLs, number of comments, selftext, and creation times of the posts. Then, it removes any rows with empty values from this DataFrame. 

Next, there is a function called 'clean_text' that takes in a DataFrame, a text field (in this case, 'title'), and a new text field name (in this case, 'clean_title'). The function converts the text to lowercase, removes any special characters or URLs, and removes any numerical digits. This function returns the DataFrame with the new cleaned text field added.

After this, the code creates a new column called 'clean_text' by removing any stop words (common words like 'the,' 'and,' 'or,' etc.) from the 'clean_body' field in the DataFrame. Then, it splits the cleaned text into individual tokens (words), creating a new column called 'text_tokens.'

Finally, the code drops several columns from the DataFrame ('title', 'body', 'text_tokens', 'subreddit', 'url', 'clean_title', and 'clean_body') that are no longer needed and removes any rows with empty values from the resulting DataFrame.
