# This file contains a set of functions and some code to use Spacy and Pandas to perform data cleaning and analysis.

# The first block of code uses Spacy to extract the most common nouns and verbs from a given text.

# The next three functions use Spacy to sanitize personal names and locations from text, and to tokenize text.

# The selected_topics function is used to show the most relevant topics in a given text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

# The next block of code uses Spacy to extract all named entities (entities with specific labels) from a Pandas DataFrame and store them in a new DataFrame.
