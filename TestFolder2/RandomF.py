The code consists of several functions and operations related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the spaCy Python library. 

The first block of code extracts the most common nouns and verbs from a given text file through a series of filters using spaCy, then prints the results.

The second block defines the "sanitize_names" function which takes a text as input and returns a sanitized version of it with all PERSON entities replaced with "[REDACTED]".

The third block defines the "sanitize_locations" function, which similarly takes a text as input but replaces all GPE (geopolitical entities) entities with "[REDACTED]".

The fourth block defines the "spacy_tokenizer" function, which takes a sentence and applies several filters to return a list of lemmatized, lowercase, and punctuation-free words.

The fifth block defines the "selected_topics" function that takes a vectorized model and returns the top words for each topic.

The sixth block extracts named entities from a given file via spaCy and stores them in a list.

The seventh and final block fills up a Pandas Data Frame with the entities from the previous block, categorized by their respective type.
