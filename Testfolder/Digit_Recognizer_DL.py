Overall, this code defines functions for performing softmax activation and its derivative, as well as relu activation and its derivative. These functions can be used in a neural network implementation.

The `softmax()` function takes in a matrix of input values `z`, calculates the softmax function for each row of the matrix using the formula `np.exp(z).T / np.sum(np.exp(z), axis=1))`, and returns the resulting matrix and the original `z` matrix for use in back-propagation.

The `relu()` function takes in a matrix of input values `z`, applies the rectified linear unit (relu) activation function to each element of the matrix using the formula `np.maximum(0, z)`, and returns the resulting matrix and the original `z` matrix for use in back-propagation.

The `softmax_backward()` function takes in a matrix of derivatives `dA` and the original `z` matrix from the softmax activation, calculates the derivative of the softmax function with respect to `z` using the formula `dZ = dA * s * (1 - s)`, and returns the resulting derivative matrix.

The `relu_backward()` function takes in a matrix of derivatives `dA` and the original `z` matrix from the relu activation, calculates the derivative of the relu function with respect to `z` using the formula `dZ = dA * (Z > 0)`, and returns the resulting derivative matrix.
