This code defines several functions for implementing two commonly used activation functions in neural networks: softmax and ReLU. The softmax function converts a set of input values into a probability distribution by taking the exponentials of the input values and normalizing them by dividing by their sum. The ReLU function applies an element-wise non-linearity to the input values, setting any negative values to zero while leaving positive values unchanged.

The functions "softmax_backward" and "relu_backward" provide the derivative of the corresponding activation functions, which can be used during backpropagation to calculate gradients and update model parameters.
