This code is a set of functions that are commonly used in neural networks and machine learning. Specifically, the code includes functions for the softmax activation function and its derivative, as well as the relu activation function and its derivative. These functions are essential for calculating the output of a neural network and updating the weights during backpropagation. The numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries are imported to facilitate the calculations and visualizations.
