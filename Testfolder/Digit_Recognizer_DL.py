Overall code description:

This code contains functions for implementing the softmax and ReLU activation functions used in deep learning models. It also includes their respective backward propagation functions for computing gradients during backpropagation.

# softmax function: computes the softmax activation for input vector z
def softmax(z):
    cache = z
    z -= np.max(z) # Subtracting max value for numerical stability
    sm = (np.exp(z).T / np.sum(np.exp(z), axis=1)) # Softmax computation
    return sm, cache

# ReLU function: computes the rectified linear unit activation for input vector z
def relu(z):
    s = np.maximum(0, z) # ReLU computation
    cache = z
    return s, cache

# softmax_backward function: performs the backward pass for softmax function during backpropagation
def softmax_backward(dA, cache):
    z = cache
    z -= np.max(z) # Subtracting max value for numerical stability
    s = (np.exp(z).T / np.sum(np.exp(z), axis=1)) # Softmax computation
    dZ = dA * s * (1 - s) # Derivative of softmax function
    return dZ

# relu_backward function: performs the backward pass for ReLU function during backpropagation
def relu_backward(dA, cache):
    Z = cache
    dZ = np.array(dA, copy=True)
    dZ[Z <= 0] = 0 # Derivative of ReLU function
    return dZ
