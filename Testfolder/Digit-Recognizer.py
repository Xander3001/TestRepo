The code reads frames from a video until it is closed using a web camera. Then it identifies some digits in the frame and runs them through three digit recognition models, based on logistic regression, shallow network, and deep network. Then, it creates a window with the original frame and the recognized digits in it. The program stops when the user presses the "ESC" key. This code seems to rely on external functions defined in other files.
