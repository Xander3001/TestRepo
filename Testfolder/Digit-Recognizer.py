This code sets up a connection to the Twitter Streaming API and listens for tweets containing the word "soccer". When a matching tweet is received, the text content of the tweet is printed to the console and sent to a client socket over the network. The client socket is established when a connection request is received on port 5555, and the script listens for incoming connections on this port. The script uses the Tweepy library to manage authentication with the Twitter API and JSON to parse the incoming tweet data.
