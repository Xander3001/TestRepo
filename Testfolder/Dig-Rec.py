This code defines a function called 'fib' which takes a single argument, 'num'. The function recursively calculates and returns the Fibonacci number at the specified position in the sequence. 

If the given input 'num' is less than or equal to 1, the function returns the value of 'num'. Otherwise, the function returns the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers. 

Lastly, the code calls the 'fib' function with an input of 10 and prints out the resulting value to the console, which should be the 10th Fibonacci number in the sequence.
